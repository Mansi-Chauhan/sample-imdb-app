# Overview of the app
This is a sample imdb web app with basic functionality which includes:
1. Search Page
    Search Title (input Field) : where user can enter any web series or movie title. As user types, you need to use make an API call and populate and update the title list beneath it.
    Title List: The list is linked with API response, where you need to render title’s image, name, genre, and year. Also, clicking on this list-item, will take user to synopses page.
    History button: Keep this button as part of the top navigation and link it with the History Page. 

2. Synopses Page
    Render the page with following details
    Title image with name 
    Genre and year [these four details are part of the first API which needs to be maintained in states]
    Synopses : Use the API to fetch synopsis of the current title ID.

3. History Page
    Here you need to maintain the list of all the titles which user clicked to check its synopses and link them to synopses pages

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
